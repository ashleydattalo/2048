PROJECT TITLE: 2048
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: I loved playing the game 2048 so much, I decided to make my own version.
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Clone this repository onto your own computer. Then, to open the UI, click run applet on twentyFortyEight.java. 
AUTHORS: Ashley Dattalo
USER INSTRUCTIONS: If you open the UI there should be instructions.

Side Note: This was the first coding project I have ever created. I wrote this code before I had ever taken any Java computer science courses in college. If I were to rewrite this code, I would do so a LOT differently and more efficiently.
