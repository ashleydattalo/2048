PROJECT TITLE: 2048

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: I loved playing the game 2048 so much, I decided to make my own version. 

COOL FEATURES:
-undo button
-different sizes and colors
-a mode where itâ€™s impossible to lose
-shifts the board so the tiles are in a more favorable position
-challenge mode (instead of adding one tile when a key is pressed, it adds a tile to all empty locations on the board)

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Clone this repository onto your own computer. Then, to open the UI, click run applet on twentyFortyEight.java.

Side Note: This was the first coding project I have worked on. I wrote this code before taking any Java computer science courses in college. If I were to rewrite this code, I would do so a LOT differently and more efficiently.
